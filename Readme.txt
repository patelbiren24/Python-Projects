\f0\fs24 \cf0 In this small program I used smtp protocol to send mails. At first I created a gmail account for testing purposes as I did not want to use my actual email for privacy reasons. Once the account was created, I went ahead and login into the account.  Then I used python script to login into my existing account and then use the smtp protocol to send the email. I then used a spam German email provider name spaml.de and created an email. If your code works, it should look similar to the screenshot I have attached. The name of the file is \'93result\'94. }
