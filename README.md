# Python-Projects

<p> In this small program I used smtp protocol to send mails. 
At first I created a gmail account for testing purposes as I did not want to use my actual email for privacy reasons.
Once the account was created, I went ahead and login into the account. 
Then I used python script to login into my existing account and then use the smtp protocol to send the email. 
I then used a spam German email provider name spaml.de and created an email.
If your code works, it should look similar to the screenshot I have attached. The name of the file is "result".
